    "title": "The Lake Isle of Inisfree",
    "author": "William Butler Yeats",
    "poem": "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\nThere midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\nAnd evening full of the linnet's wings.\n\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\nI hear it in the deep heart's core.\n"

    "author": "Ben Jonson",
    "poem": "Drink to me only with thine eyes,\n  And I will pledge with mine;\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\n  And I'll not look for wine.\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise\n  Doth ask a drink divine;\nBut might I of Jove's nectar sup,\n  I would not change for thine.\n\nI sent thee late a rosy wreath,\n  Not so much honouring thee\nAs giving it a hope, that there\n  It could not withered be.\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\n  And sent'st it back to me;\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\n  Not of itself, but thee.\n"

    "poem": "She sweeps with many-colored brooms,\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\nCome back, and dust the pond!\n\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\nYou dropped an amber thread;\nAnd now you've littered all the East\nWith duds of emerald!\n\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\nAnd still the aprons fly,\nTill brooms fade softly into stars —\nAnd then I come away.\n"

    "author": "John O'Donohue",
    "poem": "When the rhythm of the heart becomes hectic,\nTime takes on the strain until it breaks;\nThen all the unattended stress falls in\nOn the mind like an endless, increasing weight.\n\nThe light in the mind becomes dim.\nThings you could take in your stride before\nNow become laborsome events of will.\n\nWeariness invades your spirit.\nGravity begins falling inside you,\nDragging down every bone.\n\nThe tide you never valued has gone out.\nAnd you are marooned on unsure ground.\nSomething within you has closed down;\nAnd you cannot push yourself back to life.\n\nYou have been forced to enter empty time.\nThe desire that drove you has relinquished.\nThere is nothing else to do now but rest\nAnd patiently learn to receive the self\nYou have forsaken in the race of days.\n\nAt first your thinking will darken\nAnd sadness take over like listless weather.\nThe flow of unwept tears will frighten you.\n\nYou have traveled too fast over false ground;\nNow your soul has come to take you back.\n\nTake refuge in your senses, open up\nTo all the small miracles you rushed through.\n\nBecome inclined to watch the way of rain\nWhen it falls slow and free.\n\nImitate the habit of twilight,\nTaking time to open the well of color\nThat fostered the brightness of day.\n\nDraw alongside the silence of stone\nUntil its calmness can claim you.\nBe excessively gentle with yourself.\n\nStay clear of those vexed in spirit.\nLearn to linger around someone of ease\nWho feels they have all the time in the world.\n\nGradually, you will return to yourself,\nHaving learned a new respect for your heart\nAnd the joy that dwells far within slow time.`\n"

    "title": "Sonnet 54",
    "author": "William Shakespeare",
    "poem": "O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\nFor that sweet odour which doth in it live.\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye\nAs the perfumèd tincture of the roses,\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly\nWhen summer's breath their maskèd buds discloses;\nBut, for their virtue only is their show,\nThey live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;\nOf their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made.\nAnd so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\nWhen that shall fade, by verse distils your truth.\n"

    "poem": "If Zeus chose us a King of the flowers in his mirth,\nHe would call to the rose and would royally crown it,\nFor the rose, ho, the rose! is the grace of the earth,\nIs the light of the plants that are growing upon it.\nFor the rose, ho, the rose! is the eye of the flowers,\nIs the blush of the meadows that feel themselves fair,--\nIs the lightning of beauty, that strikes through the bowers\nOn pale lovers who sit in the glow unaware.\nHo, the rose breathes of love! ho, the rose, lifts the cup\nTo the red lips of Cypris invoked for a guest!\nHo, the rose, having curled its sweet leaves for the world,\nTakes delight in the motion its petals keep up,\nAs they laugh to the Wind as it laughs from the west.\n"

    "poem": "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\nA stately pleasure-dome decree:\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\nThrough caverns measureless to man\n   Down to a sunless sea.\nSo twice five miles of fertile ground\nWith walls and towers were girdled round;\nAnd there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\nWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\nAnd here were forests ancient as the hills,\nEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.\n\nBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted\nDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!\nA savage place! as holy and enchanted\nAs e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted\nBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!\nAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,\nAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\nA mighty fountain momently was forced:\nAmid whose swift half-intermitted burst\nHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,\nOr chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:\nAnd mid these dancing rocks at once and ever\nIt flung up momently the sacred river.\nFive miles meandering with a mazy motion\nThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,\nThen reached the caverns measureless to man,\nAnd sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;\nAnd ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far\nAncestral voices prophesying war!\n   The shadow of the dome of pleasure\n   Floated midway on the waves;\n   Where was heard the mingled measure\n   From the fountain and the caves.\nIt was a miracle of rare device,\nA sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!\n\n   A damsel with a dulcimer\n   In a vision once I saw:\n   It was an Abyssinian maid\n   And on her dulcimer she played,\n   Singing of Mount Abora.\n   Could I revive within me\n   Her symphony and song,\n   To such a deep delight ’twould win me,\nThat with music loud and long,\nI would build that dome in air,\nThat sunny dome! those caves of ice!\nAnd all who heard should see them there,\nAnd all should cry, Beware! Beware!\nHis flashing eyes, his floating hair!\nWeave a circle round him thrice,\nAnd close your eyes with holy dread\nFor he on honey-dew hath fed,\nAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.\n"

    "poem": "Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)\nAwoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\nAnd saw, within the moonlight in his room,\nMaking it rich, and like a lily in bloom,\nAn angel writing in a book of gold:—\nExceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,\nAnd to the presence in the room he said,\n\"What writest thou?\"—The vision raised its head,\nAnd with a look made of all sweet accord,\nAnswered, \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"\n\"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"\nReplied the angel. Abou spoke more low,\nBut cheerly still; and said, \"I pray thee, then,\nWrite me as one that loves his fellow men.\"\n\nThe angel wrote, and vanished. The next night\nIt came again with a great wakening light,\nAnd showed the names whom love of God had blest,\nAnd lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.\n"

    "poem": "Darling, the body is a guest house;\nevery morning someone new arrives.\nDon't say, “O, another weight around my neck!”\nor your guest will fly back to nothingness.\nWhatever enters your heart is a guest\nfrom the invisible world: entertain it well.\n\nEvery day, and every moment, a thought comes\nlike an honored guest into your heart.\nMy soul, regard each thought as a person,\nfor every person's value is in the thought they hold.\n\nIf a sorrowful thought stands in the way,\nit is also preparing the way for joy.\nIt furiously sweeps your house clean,\nin order that some new joy may appear from the Source.\nIt scatters the withered leaves from the bough of the heart,\nin order that fresh green leaves might grow.\nIt uproots the old joy so that\na new joy may enter from Beyond.\n\nSorrow pulls up the rotten root\nthat was veiled from sight.\nWhatever sorrow takes away or causes the heart to shed,\nit puts something better in its place-\nespecially for one who is certain\nthat sorrow is the servant of the intuitive.\n\nWithout the frown of clouds and lightning,\nthe vines would be burned by the smiling sun.\nBoth good and bad luck become guests in your heart:\nlike planets traveling from sign to sign.\nWhen something transits your sign, adapt yourself,\nand be as harmonious as its ruling sign,\nso that when it rejoins the Moon,\nit will speak kindly to the Lord of the heart.\n\nWhenever sorrow comes again,\nmeet it with smiles and laughter,\nsaying, “O my Creator, save me from its harm,\nand do not deprive me of its good.\nLord, remind me to be thankful,\nlet me feel no regret if its benefit passes away.”\n\nAnd if the pearl is not in sorrow's hand,\nlet it go and still be pleased.\nIncrease your sweet practice.\nYour practice will benefit you at another time;\nsomeday your need will be suddenly fulfilled.\n"

    "poem": "Sentenced to life, I sleep face-up as though\nIce-bound, lest I should cough the night away,\nAnd when I walk the mile to town, I show\nThe right technique for wading through deep clay.\nA sad man, sorrier than he can say.\n\nBut surely not so guilty he should die\nEach day from knowing that his race is run:\nMy sin was to be faithless. I would lie\nAs if I could be true to everyone\nAt once, and all the damage that was done\n\nWas in the name of love, or so I thought.\nI might have met my death believing this,\nBut no, there was a lesson to be taught.\nNow, not just old, but ill, with much amiss,\nI see things with a whole new emphasis.\n\nMy daughter's garden has a goldfish pool\nWith six fish, each a little finger long.\nI stand and watch them following their rule\nOf never touching, never going wrong:\nTrajectories as perfect as plain song.\n\nOnce, I would not have noticed; nor have known\nThe name for Japanese anemones,\nSo pale, so frail. But now I catch the tone\nOf leaves. No birds can touch down in the trees\nWithout my seeing them. I count the bees.\n\nEven my memories are clearly seen:\nWhence comes the answer if I'm told I must\nBe aching for my homeland. Had I been\nDulled in the brain to match my lungs of dust\nThere'd be no recollection I could trust.\n\nYet I, despite my guilt, despite my grief,\nWatch the Pacific sunset, heaven sent,\nIn glowing colours and in sharp relief,\nPainting the white clouds when the day is spent,\nAs if it were my will and testament —\n\nAs if my first impressions were my last,\nAnd time had only made them more defined,\nNow I am weak. The sky is overcast\nHere in the English autumn, but my mind\nBasks in the light I never left behind.\n"
